# A clustering based social matrix factorization technique for personalized recommender systems

This is the implementation of the CREPE algorithm mentioned in LR D, Tamhane A, Pervin N. A Clustering Based Social Matrix Factorization Technique for Personalized Recommender Systems.

CREPE is a matrix factorization based algorithm for generating restaurant recommendations.

There are 3 main parts to the algorithm: 
1) Clustering users and businesses based on their ratings patterns.
2) Generating the user-user preference network and item-item similarity network.
3) Training the recommender system basem to generate predictions.
